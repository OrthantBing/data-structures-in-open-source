# Data Structures in Open Source

A list of data structures used in Open Source projects in various languages and projects around the web. 
- This list is primarily intended for CS students learning about these structures, and who want to see real-world examples outside the  world of textbooks and competitive programming. 
- It is also intended for curious developers who already know the concepts, but haven't seen practical usage in production code. 
- Finally, it is also intended for experienced developers and contributers whose deep inside knowledge of OSS projects would help students and learners around the world get a feel for raw code, and how theory translates into practice.

All languages, frameworks, and libraries are welcome.
